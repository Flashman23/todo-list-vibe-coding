Vibe Coding Tool:

This project was mainly developed using v0.dev
 by Vercel.

v0.dev is an AI-powered UI generation tool that creates React and Next.js components from natural language prompts.
It was used to generate most of the application structure, UI components, and logic, which were then tested locally in VS Code.
