Development Experience with v0.dev
Tool Selection

For this project, I used v0.dev as a vibe coding tool. I chose this tool because it allows developers to generate complete React and Next.js components from natural language prompts. Unlike classical autocomplete tools that only suggest code line by line.

I found v0.dev useful as a student because it reduces the technical barrier of setting up a project and focuses more on understanding how an application works 

Development Process

I started the project by giving v0.dev a clear prompt describing the requirements of the Todo List application. The prompt included features such as adding, editing, deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and saving data using localStorage.

The development process was fast and iterative. Each time I asked for a modification, the tool updated only the relevant parts of the code. This helped me understand the structure of the application and how different components work together.

Challenges and Solutions

The main difficulties I encountered were not related to the code itself, but to the local development environment. When I tried to run the project using VS Code, I faced an error caused by Windows PowerShell execution policies, which blocked npm commands.

At first, this was confusing because I thought the problem came from the code. After switching the terminal from PowerShell to CMD, the issue was resolved and the project ran correctly using npm install and npm run dev.

Reflection on Vibe Coding

This experience showed me that vibe coding tools like v0.dev do not replace developers, but instead assist them. Even though the AI generated most of the code, I still needed basic knowledge of programming concepts, project structure, and development tools like Node.js and npm to run and test the application.

Vibe coding allowed me to focus more on understanding the logic of the application and less on syntax and configuration. However, when problems occurred, human reasoning was still necessary to identify and solve them.

Overall, using v0.dev helped me better understand modern web development workflows and demonstrated how AI can be used as a powerful learning and productivity tool rather than a replacement for developers.
